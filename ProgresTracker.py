#
# Description:
# This script continuously monitors a specified API endpoint. It sends a
# notification to a Telegram group if the API status changes from "up" to "down"
# or vice-versa.
#
# How to Configure:
# 1. Fill in the placeholders in the "CONFIGURATION" section below.
# 2. You will need a Telegram Bot Token from @BotFather.
# 3. You will need the Chat ID of your group. You can get this by adding a
#    bot like @RawDataBot to your group and checking the JSON data.
#
# Important Note on API Accessibility:
# This script can only monitor APIs that are publicly accessible from the
# server where the script is running. Some APIs use geoblocking (restricting
# access based on country) or require authentication (like a JWT token).
# If an API uses these security measures, this simple script will not be
# able to access it from a standard international hosting provider.
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

from time import sleep

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# Fill in these values before running the script.

# The URL of the API you want to monitor.
API_URL = "https://progres.mesrs.dz/api/infos"  # <-- Change this to your target API

# Your Telegram Bot's Token from @BotFather.
BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"  # <-- IMPORTANT: Paste your Bot Token here

# The chat ID(s) of the Telegram group(s) you want to send messages to.
# Group IDs usually start with a hyphen (-).
# To add more than one group, separate them with a comma: ("-100...", "-100...")
GROUPS_IDS = ("YOUR_GROUP_ID_HERE",)  # <-- IMPORTANT: Paste your Group ID here

# How many times the API must fail in a row before sending a "down" alert.

# How many seconds to wait between each check.
# A low number like 10 is good for testing. For real use, consider a longer
# time like 300 (5 minutes) or 900 (15 minutes) to avoid making too many requests.
